# ExileCraft

ExileCraft is an open-source crafting helper application designed for the popular online action RPG, Path of Exile. The application is built using Python, SQLite, and PyQt5, offering a rich, user-friendly GUI for users to simulate crafting projects and draws it's inspiration heavily from the popular/invaluable web application [Craft of Exile](https://www.craftofexile.com/).

# Getting Started

# Planned Features:

### Crafting project management
Before risking your hard earned currency this application is here for you to simulate crafting items without ever having to tab out of the game. You can start from scratch as well as import items you already have in game to see what options you have available to you.

- See a list of all possible modifiers for the items based off of your selection using the GUI or based off of an item you imported from PathOfExile.
- Save crafting projects to come back to later, along with a history of the crafting steps taken to create the item
- Compare estimated costs of different crafting methods
- Simulate crafting items, experiment with different crafting methods, calculate probabilities
